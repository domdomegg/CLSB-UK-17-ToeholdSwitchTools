# CLSB-UK: Toehold Switch Tools

Designing toehold switches is tedious as there are many predetermined regions. To speed up our design process we automated these regions, allowing our design team to create and model more switches to optimize the dynamic range and output of our sensors.

These extremely simple tools are free to use and can be built upon by other iGEM teams - the code is split into plenty of useful functions which could easily be modified to design other similarly repetitive sequences.

This version is exactly the same thing our design team used, except with the style spruced up a bit and a reset button.

More information, including usage instructions are available on our [iGEM wiki](http://2017.igem.org/Team:CLSB-UK/Software/ToeholdSwitchTools).

## Installation

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. We've thoroughly tested it on standards compliant browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, but did make an effort to use older, more widely supported techniques so it *should* work even on IE9 (sadly, we wanted to take a functional programming approach with arrow functions everywhere but couldn't cause IE - the end product is exactly the same though).

We built it to run in a web browser to make it as easy as possible to use for our design team - we could simply send them a link to a site.

To view it directly on our wiki so you don't need to download it, [click here](http://2017.igem.org/Team:CLSB-UK/Software/ToeholdSwitchTools). There is no difference in the logic between that page and the one uploaded here, except some of the styles are slightly different.

## Structure

* `index.html` is the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code that contains everything to run Toehold Switch Tools in the browser.
